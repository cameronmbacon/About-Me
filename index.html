      <h1>Cameron's About Me Page</h1>
      <p>Hi Everyone! My name is Cameron Bacon and I live in Seattle, Washington...or...Everett...close enough! I am 24, I served on the USS Maine (Gold Crew), and I am the luckiest father to two of the most beautiful children in the world. This page comes with a 5-question guessing game that's all about me! The questions and your accompanying answers will appear below when you have finished the game. Good luck!<hr /></p>
