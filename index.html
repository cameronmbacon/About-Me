        <h3>Who Is Cameron?</h3>
        <p>Hi, everybody! I just want to start by saying that I am very excited to be a student here at Code Fellows and I am looking forward to where the rest of this journey takes me. I'm 24-years-old and currently live in Everett, WA. I grew up in Montana, then my family and I moved out to the great state of Washington when I was 10. I graduated high school in 2010 from Lake Stevens High School. I joined the Navy while still in high school and ended up becoming an Electrician's Mate on the USS Maine (SSBN 741G), which is a Ballistic Missile Submarine. Being under water wasn't an issue for me, if anything, it was the fact that ballistic missie submarines do not port while they are on deployment since most countries don't like nukes sitting in their port. I finished my naval career in 2014 and hastily tried to prepare for my next role: <strong>Father</strong>. I have two beautiful children who couldn't be any more perfect! My daughter, Autumn, is two and is the sweetest toddler you'll ever meet. Tyler was the newest addition to the family and he is 7-months. His smile and laugh are contagious to all. On a typical day, you can find me shredding it up on the electric guitar, hanging out with the two greatest kids in the world, or studying to become a better web developer.</p>
